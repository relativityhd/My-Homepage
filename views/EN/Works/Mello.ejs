          <p class="work-text">Last year we carried out a software project simulation in computer science lessons. Together with three others from my course I developed Mello. Mello is a social media site where the user could decide more. You can find a complete report in this pdf or in this presentation:</p>

          <p class="work-text">You can download and try it out, but don't use it in public. To start the project, de-zip the package, edit the path in the 'mello.bat' file and then start that file. You need to have installed Mongo-DB and Node.js. It will starts automaticly, but it needs a while to start, maybe refresh the side after 20 secs.</p>
